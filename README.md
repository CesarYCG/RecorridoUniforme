# Algoritmo de Recorrido Uniforme en Python üçï
Algorithm and program designed to represent the uniform-cost search in Python with a given map of Romania with step costs in Km. 
This algorithm it would be capable of travel to any city (needs to be into the map) i.e from Vaslui to Zerind or Timisoara to Efoire.
This program should show how the rute is choosen step by step, giving the final trayectory with the total cost. 
*Note: The method response isn't optimal for all the cases*
